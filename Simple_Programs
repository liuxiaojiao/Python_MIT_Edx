## The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
## The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? 
## Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!print("Think a number between 0 to 100")

print("Think a number between 0 - 100")

l = 0
h = 100
s = ''
guesstime = 1

while s != 'c':     
    ans=(l+h)/2    
    print(ans)    
    s = raw_input("if the number is h or l than yours: ")    
    if s.lower() not in ('h','l','c'):        
        print("invalid input - try again")        
        s = raw_input("if the number is h or l than yours: ")     
    if s.lower() == 'c':        
        break    
    elif s.lower() == 'h':        
        h = ans    
    else:        
        l = ans    
    guesstime += 1    
    
print (str(ans) + ' is the number in your mind, and I use ' + str(guesstime)+' times to get it.')
