## The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
## The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? 
## Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!print("Think a number between 0 to 100")

print ("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
l = 0
h = 100
s = ''
guesstime = 1

while s != 'c': 
    ans=int((l+h)/2)
    print("Is your secret number "+str(ans)+"?")
    
    s = raw_input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
    
    if s.lower() not in ('h','l','c'):
        print("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
       
    else:
        if s.lower() == 'c':
            break
        elif s.lower() == 'h':
            h = ans
        else:
            l = ans
        guesstime += 1
    
print ('Game over. Your secret number was:' + str(ans))
